Problem 5:
Create a requirements.yml file in the /home/sean/ansible directory with the following conditions:

Role 1 (nginx):

Role Name: nginx
Download URL: geerlingguy.nginx
Role 2 (firewall):

Role Name: firewall
Repository: geerlingguy.firewall
Install the role: Ensure the firewall role is installed only if it's not already present on the system.


Tasks:
Create a requirements.yml file in /home/sean/ansible directory.
The file should specify the nginx role to be downloaded from the provided URL.
The file should specify the firewall role to be installed from GitHub if not already installed.
Run the playbook to install these roles.
Hint:
Use ansible-galaxy install -r /home/sean/ansible/requirements.yml to install the roles from the requirements.yml file.







Solution

vim requirements.yml

---  
     
roles:
  - name: nginx
    src: geerlingguy.nginx
     
  - name: firewall
    src: geerlingguy.firewall


ansible-galaxy install -r /home/sean/ansible/requirements.yml
