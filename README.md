# RHCE Study Notes

## Overview
Welcome to my RHCE Study Notes repository! This project is a collection of personal notes, scripts, and resources compiled during my preparation for the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certification. It builds on my foundational skills from the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) certification and focuses on advanced Linux system administration topics like automation, networking, and security.

This repository serves as both a study tool for myself and a resource for others pursuing RHCE or similar Linux certifications. Contributions or suggestions are welcome!

## Contents
- **Notes**: Detailed markdown files covering RHCE objectives, such as Ansible automation, system performance tuning, and advanced storage management.
- **Scripts**: Practical Bash scripts demonstrating automation tasks, system configurations, or troubleshooting techniques aligned with RHCE goals.
- **Configs**: Sample configuration files (e.g., `/etc` snippets, Ansible playbooks) used for hands-on practice in virtualized environments like CentOS or RHEL.

## Key Features
- **RHCE-Focused**: Organized around the latest RHCE exam objectives (as of March 2025).
- **Hands-On Learning**: Includes real-world examples from my lab environment (e.g., VirtualBox, Vagrant, or RHEL VMs).
- **Self-Documented**: Notes and scripts are annotated for clarity and quick reference.
