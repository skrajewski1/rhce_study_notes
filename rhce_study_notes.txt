1. Note to Reader 

These are my personal notes I used for studying for Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) exam (EX294).  
I decided to keep with the running theme of documenting my notes on GitHub.
This isn't meant to be 100% thorough.  RHCE has more advanced networking, security, and introduces automation.
I would say it's a entry point into DevOps concepts in a practical sense.
There is about 20 question on the exam and you need a passing score of 210/300 (70%). No multiple-choice questions!
My experience and those I've talked to that have done the RHCSA to RHCE is to do focus on getting the RHCE as soon as possible.
If you know how to use Ansible you will have a big advantage.  A lot of the RHCE is based on automation via Ansible playbooks.
Again, use my notes if it helps. I'm using Luca Berton's book (see below) as my main study source.

3. RHEL Basics

lifecycle of RHEL:  full support(5yr), maintenance support (5yr), extended life cycle support (ELS) add-on

Benefits of RHEL:
CPU architectures supported: 86x, ARM, IBM Power, IBM Z, IBM LinuxONE
RHEL includes Ansible automation tech
Red Hat insights provides analytics/remediation  = suppose to maximize uptime and avoid emergencies
Migration tools + RHEL image builder for cloud deployments
live kernel patching, security profiles, trusted software supply chain, automate security processes
performance monitoring/analysis tools
Convert2RHEl tool streamlines the migration process from RPM compatible linux distros like Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux OS, etc
various use cases: edge computing, hybrid cloud deployments, SAP workloads, SQL server hosting, applicaiton development, and high-performance computing (HPC)
Collaborations with cloud providers like GPC, AWS, Azure, Oracle


RHEL installer is called Anaconda  (same for CentOS and Fedora)




### subscription manager

subscription-manager register --username=<name> --password=<pw>

#see available subscriptions
suscription-manager list --available | less

#attach subscription 
subscription-manager attach --auto

#unregister the system
subscription-manager unregister


###shutting down commands

you generally want to limit shutdowns/downtime.  instead try restarting (covered in next section)

#shutdown and restart now 
shutdown -r now

#schedule shutdown at 23:00
shutdown --halt 23:00

#shutdown in 2 minutes
shutdown --halt +2

#shutdown in 2 minutes with a message broadcasted to users logged in
shudown --halt +2 "Urgent. Shudown in TWO minutes."

#cancel shutdown  (this will also be broadcasted to users logged in)
shutdown -c


### Reboot

limitation of systemctl is its inability to do delayed restarts (either now or never)

#restart a service
systemctl restart <service name>

#restart the system (same as effect as shutdown -r now)
systemctl reboot


### Suspending and hibernating

suspension
+ system shuts down (no-power mode)
+ contents of memory are moved to the swap location. on powerup, system reloads from swap
+ boot loader is configured to boot directly to the current kernel

systemctl suspend


hibernation
+ the ystem remains powered on but in a low-power state
+ applications are stopped
+ system state is moved to ram

systemctl hibernate

#combines both
systemctl hybrid-sleep
