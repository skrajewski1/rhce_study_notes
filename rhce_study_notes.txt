1. Note to Reader 

These are my personal notes I used for studying for Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) exam (EX294).  
I decided to keep with the running theme of documenting my notes on GitHub.
This isn't meant to be 100% thorough.  RHCE has more advanced networking, security, and introduces automation.
I would say it's a entry point into DevOps concepts in a practical sense.
There isn't a specific number of questions on the exam but a passing score is 210/300 (70%)
