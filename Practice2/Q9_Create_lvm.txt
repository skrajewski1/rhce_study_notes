Q9. Create LVM

Create a playbook called /home/sean/ansible/lvm.yml that runs on all managed nodes that does the following:

*Creates a logical volume with these requirements:
    - the lvm is created in the research volume group
    - the lvm is named data
    - the lvm size is 1.5GB
*Format the logical volume with the ext4 file system
* if the requested lvm size cannot be created, the error message should be could not create lvm of that size 
should be displayed and size 800mb should be used installed
*if the volume research does not exist, the error messag volume group doesn not exits should be displayed
does not mount the logical volume in any way









































Solution:


vim /home/sean/ansible/lvm.yml

---
- name: to configure logical volume
  hosts: servera
  ignore_errors: yes
  vars: 
    lvsize: "1500"
  tasks: 
    - name: to check vgs is present or not
      command: vgs research
      register: vg_status

    - name: error message volume group does not exits should be displayed
      debug: 
        msg: "volume group does not exits"
      when: vg_status is failed
    
    - name: Create logical volume 'data'
      lvol:
        vg: research
        lv: data
        size: "{{ lvsize }}"
      when: vg_status.rc == 0
      register: lv_status
      ignore_errors: yes
    
    - debug: var=lv_status

    - name: error message logical volume not created 
      debug: 
        msg: "could not create logical volume of {{ lvsize }} size 800 MiB should be used instead"
      when: lv_status is failed and '"insufficent free space" in lv_status.err'

    - name: format the logical volume in ext4 filesystem
      filesystem: 
        fstype: ext4
        dev: /dev/research/data
      when: lv_status.rc == 0
