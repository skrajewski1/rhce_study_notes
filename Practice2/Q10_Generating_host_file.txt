Q10. Generating_host_file

complete the template file so that it can be used to generate a file with a line for each host in the same foramt as /etc/hosts:
172.25.250.9 workstation.lab.example.com workstation

create a playbook called /home/student/ansible/hosts.yml that uses this template to generate the file
/etc/myhosts on host in the dev hostgroup

when the playbook is run, the file /etc/myhosts on dev hostgroup should have a line for each manged hosts:







































Solution:

wget http://materials.example.com/hosts.j2
vim hosts.j2

{% for host in groups['dev'] %}
{{ hostvars['host']['ansible_facts']['default_ipv4']['address'] }} {{ hostvars['serverd']['ansible_facts']['fqdn'] }}
{{ hostvars['serverb']['ansible_facts']['hostname'] }}
{% endfor %}

vim hosts.yml
- name: /etc/myhosts is up to date 
  hosts: dev
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy /etc/myhosts
      template:
        src: host.j2
        dest: /etc/myhost
