Q13. Generate a hardware report 


create a playbook called /home/sean/ansible/hwreport.yml that produces an output file called:
/root/hwreport.txt on all managed nodes with the following information:
- inventory hostname
- total memory in MB 
- BIOS version
- Size of disk device vda
- Size of disk device vdb
- Each line of the output file contains a single key=value parity
* your playbook should
- Download the file from http://server.network.example.com/materials/hwreport.empty and save it as /root/hwreport.txt
- modify /root/hwreport.txt with the correct values






































Solution:

wget http://materials.example.com/hwreport.empty

vim hwreport.yml

---
- hosts: servera serverb serverc
  tasks: 
    - name: Download hwreport.empty file and save it as hwreport.txt file under
      get_url:
        url: http://materials.example.com/hwreport.empty
        dest: /root/hwreport.txt
    - name: collect hw information from all node in /root/hwreport.txt file
      copy:
        dest: /root/hwreport.txt
        content: "Inventory Hostname: {{ ansible_facts['hostname'] }}\nTotal Memory in MB: {{ ansible_facts['memtotoal_mb'] }}\n
        BIOS Version: {{ ansible_facts['bios_version'] }}\nSize of disk device vda: {{ ansible_facts ['device']['vda']['size'] }}\n 
        Size of disk device vdb: {{ ansible_facts ['devices']['vdb']['size'] }}\n"
