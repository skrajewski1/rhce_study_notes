Q3. Install packages
Create a playbook called /home/student/ansible/packages.yml and perform the following tasks:

    - install the php and mariadb on hosts in the dev,test and prod host group
    - install the rpm development tools package group on host in the dev host group
    - update all packages to the lastest version on host in the dev host group








































Solution:

vim /home/sean/ansible/packages.yml


---      
- name: Install the php and mariadb on the dev,test, and prod hostgroup
  hosts: dev test prod
  become: true
  tasks: 
    - name: to install package
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name:
          - mariadb
          - php
        state: latest
         
         
- name: Install the RPM Development Tools package group on the dev host group
  hosts: dev
  become: true
  tasks: 
    - name: to install tool
      yum:
        name: "@RPM Development Tools"
        state: latest
         
    - name: Update all packages to the latest version on the dev host group
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: "*"
        state: latest
