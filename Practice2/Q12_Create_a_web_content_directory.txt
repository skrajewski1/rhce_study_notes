Q12. Create a web contnet directory

Create a playbook called /home/student/ansible/webcontent.yml as follows:
- The playbook runs managed node in the dev hostgroup
- Create the directory /webdev with the following requirment:
    membership in the webdev group
    it has regular permissions: owner=rwx, group=rwx, other=rx
    it has specialpermission: set group GID
Symbolically link /var/www/html/webdev to /webdev
Create the file /webdev/index.html with a single line of txt that reads: Development
Browsing this directory on host in the dev host group ( for example http://serverd.lab.example.com/webdev/) produces the following output: 
Development

Note: - need to check the webdev group exists or not.  if not create it and some time question as about apache in place of webdev group in that case 
we don't need to create tapache group its already there by default.
