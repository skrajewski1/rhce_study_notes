Q11. Modify the file content


Create a playbook called /home/student/ansible/issue.yml
- The playbook runs on all managed hosts
- The playbook replaces the content of /etc/issue with a single line of text as follows:
    On hosts in the dev hostgroup, the line reads: Development
    On hosts in the test hostgroup, the line reads: Test
    On hosts in the prod hostgroup, the line read: Production





































Solution:

vim issue.yml

---    
- name: The palybook replaces the contnet of /etc/issue with a singl line of text
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Development
      copy:
        content: "Developmen\n"
        dest: /etc/issue
      when: inventory_hostname in groups["dev"]
       
    - name: Test
      copy:
        content: "Test\n"
        dest: /etc/issue
      when: inventory_hostname in groups["test"]
       
    - name: Production
      copy:
