#basic structure of an adhoc commands
ansible <hosts> -m <module> [-a 'module arguments'][-i inventory]


Example:

#creates lisa on all your managed servers
ansible all -m user -a "name=lisa"

#checks if the user lisa exists.
ansible all -m user -a "id lisa"

#remove user lisa
ansible all -m user -a 'name=lisa state=absent'

ansible all -m ping



ansible-doc -l              #lists all the modules you can look up
ansible-doc -l | wc -l      #shows the number of modules

#Essential Modules

ping: verifies the ability to log in and that Python has been installed
ansible all -m ping

service: checks if a service is currently running
ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

command: runs any command, but not through a shell
ansible all -m command -a "/sbin/reboot -t now"

shell: runs arbitrary comand through a shell
ansible all -m shell -a set

raw: runs a command on a remote host without a need for python     #this is useful for servers that haven't been set up yet i.e. no python installed
 
copy: copies a file to the managed host
ansible all -m copy -a 'content="hello world" dest=/etc/motd'


examples:

ansible all -m service -a "name=sshd state=started"
ansible node3 -m command -a "/sbin/reboot"
ansible all -m shell -a set
ansible all -m copy -a 'content="hello world" dest=/etc/motd'
ansible all -m shell -a 'cat /etc/motd'                               #perfect example of using ansible to check if something was done vs ssh to the server


ansible -u root -i inventory node3 --ask-pass -m raw -a 'yum install python3 -y'              #install python3 on a machine without it already installed
