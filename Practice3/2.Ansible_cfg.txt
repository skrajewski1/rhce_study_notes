#ansible.cfg files

[defaults] sets default settings
[privilege_escalation] specifies how ansible runs commands on managed hosts

inventory says where the inventory files is
remote_user is the name of the user that will communicate with the nodes. (can't be root!)
for the remote_user it's best to use a user like 'ansible' or something like that.

ask_pass = is for whether to prompt for a password
become = indicates if you want to automatically switch to the become_user
become_method = sets how to become the other user
become_user = specifies the target remote user
become_ask_pass = sets if a password should be asked for when escalating  (if set to false it's not very secure but convient)


#Here is the connection method for managing Windows  (not on the RHCE)
ansible_connection:winrm 
ansible_port 5986

Example of a ansible.cfg file:

[default]
inventory = inventory
remote_user = ansible
host_key_checking = false


[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = false

#managing ansible.cfg

ansible.cfg file is considered in order of precedence:
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is the default
~/.ansible.cfg if exists will overwrite the default
./ansible.cfg is the configuration file in the current ansible
project directory and it will always have precedence if it exists

Can use a variable ANSIBLE_CONFIG  will always have highest precedence

use ansible --version to see which one is being used
